## (1) Setting up your main class Repository in GitHub

**NOTE: You only need to set up your class repository ONCE in the beginning of the semester. We followed these steps in class, so if you already have a class Repo, skip to Section 2. **

- [ ] **(1)** login to your GitHub account and create a new Repository (or "Repo"), with a README page. 

      *Remember, whatever you call this Repository will be part of your GitHub site link.*
      *There should be <u>NO SPACES</u> in the Repo name*

- [ ] **(2)** go into the Settings tab for the Repo and activate GitHub Pages. 

      *It will take a few minutes for the site link to become active, so we'll give it a moment to check that it worked in a browser.*


- [ ] **(3)** now that it's been a few minutes, let's check on the main site link for the main class Repo you made.

      Is it loading the README page? (*Or an index.html page you optionally uploaded?*) YAY!


#### **Here's the show-me-don't-tell-me version!**

â€‹	**(1)** Create your Repo for all your classwork (no spaces in the name!):

â€‹	**(2)** Activate GitHub Pages in the Settings

â€‹	**(3)** Wait a few minutes, then check that your class Repo is loading in the browser:

**REPEATED NOTE: You only need to set up your class repository ONCE in the beginning of the semester. Once you've set up your main Repo for the class, you don't need to create another one.**  

Everytime you want to upload your work, follow the instructions below to upload your site folder to the repo and test it in the browser:





## (2) Uploading your work to your class Repo in GitHub

- [ ] **(1)** back in the "Code" tab of your class Repo, click on the "Upload Files" button and grab your p5 sketch folder and drop it onto the browser. 

      *Remember the folder will become part of the live link, so <u>NO SPACES</u> in the folder name.*  

- [ ] **(2)** add a "commit" message to indicate what is new about this upload 

      *Are you updating something by re-uploading it? Are you uploading something for the first time? Make a note of what's happening in this commit/upload*

      -> then click "Commit Changes"

- [ ] **(3)** and now that we've waited a few minutes for the p5 sketch to upload, let's check the url within the Repo to see if it's online. 

      *To get directly to the sketch you can add the folder name to the end of your main repo site link:* 

      *http://yourGithubUsername.github.io/yourRepoName/yourSketchFolderName*

      Is it working? YAY!

## ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ WOOHOO! YOU NOW HAVE TWO LINKS:

**(1)** your **live sketch** on your GitHub pages site (yourusername.github.io/â€¦.):

(i.e. https://yourusername.github.io/yourRepoName/yourSketchFolder)

Here's my live sketch: https://sheivaedu.github.io/design-interaction/wk2_inclass01_builtinVariables/

**(2)** your p5 sketch **code** (github.com/yourusername/â€¦.): 

(i.e. https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/yourRepoName/tree/master/yourSketchFolder/sketch.js)

Here's my code: https://github.com/sheivaEdu/design-interaction/blob/master/wk2_inclass01_builtinVariables/sketch.js
